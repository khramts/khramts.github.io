&lt;h2 id=&#34;biography:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Medicine, &lt;a href=&#34;http://medicine.uchicago.edu/genetic/index.html&#34;&gt;Section of Genetic Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.igsb.anl.gov/&#34;&gt;Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Chicago, working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.igsb.org/labs/barbara-stranger&#34;&gt;Barbara E. Stranger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, my research interests encompass understanding the underlying genetic differences in sexually dimorphic disease phenotypes and variable pharmacologic responses between men and women. Trained as a physiologist, studying the role of the tight junction in inflammatory bowel disease, I became interested in clinical pharmacology and pharmacogenomics. To learn how individualâ€™s genetic background can influence response to drugs and to gain computational biology skills, I started working on a project focused on assessing the effect that sexual dimorphism may have on the development of neuropathy in response to anti-cancer treatment. My experience working on a pharmacogenomics projects has encouraged me to pursue further training in statistical genetics and computation biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current project in the Stranger lab and in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://faculty.mc.vanderbilt.edu/Faculty/Details/40576&#34;&gt;Lea K. Davis&lt;/a&gt; at Vanderbilt University focuses on examining the interaction between sex and polygenic risk across neuropsychiatric phenotypes that exhibit sexual dimorphism. Understanding sex-specific differences in development and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders will better allow scientists to develop personalized treatments and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
